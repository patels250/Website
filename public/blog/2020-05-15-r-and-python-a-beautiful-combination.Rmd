Hello everybody. Today I will be doing a short demonstration on how R and Python can be used simultaneously in an R Markdown file. First, let's load in the reticulate and tidyverse packages in R.
```{r}
library(reticulate)
library(tidyverse)
```

Next, let's create two vectors of length 100 using the random module in Python. Both of these vectors will be created using for loops and the random integer function from the random module. The integers will be chosen randomly between 1 and 1,000.
```{python}
import random

x = []
for i in range(100):
  x.append(random.randint(1, 1000))
print(x)

y = []
for i in range(100):
  y.append(random.randint(1, 1000))
print(y)
```

Now, let's switch over to R. First, we're going to create a dataframe using our x and y vectors from Python. Then, we're going to use ggplot2 to create a scatterplot of the two vectors above.
```{r}
df = data.frame(x = py$x, y = py$y)
ggplot(data = df, aes(x = x, y = y)) + geom_point()
```

And that's it! We've successfully used the reticulate package to use R and Python simultaneously in an R Markdown file. I encourage you to explore this further. Happy programming!
